## 🔍 Project Overview

The project demonstrates a **Phishing Simulation** designed **purely for educational and awareness purposes**.  
It includes a **mock phishing email**  using **SMPT Mail server**and a **non-malicious landing page** to help understand:
- How phishing attempts are structured  
- How users can identify and avoid them  
- How AI can detect suspicious email patterns
- ## 🌐 Live Demo
